A component that returns another component instead of JSX. They are just functions that returns components. HOCs used for sharing complex behaviour between multiple components (similar to Container components). They are also help us with adding extra functionality to existing components.

```
MyComponent ---> <h1>I'm JSX!</h1>

HOC ---> SomeComponent ---> <h1>I'm JSX!</h1>
```

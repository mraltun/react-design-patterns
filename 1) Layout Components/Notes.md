## Layout Components

They are React components that deal primarily with arranging other components on the page. Things like Split Screen (multiple components on the same page), List and Items and Modals. Our components shouldn't know where they're being displayed.

Parent:<div>{children}</div> Children:<>Component Code</>

Using React Fragments inside child component is to make the parent component to decide it's styles.
